Skilled with words, languages come easily to him. He instinctively understands how the world works through the power of story.</p> <p>Meet Dodger, his twin. Numbers are her world, her obsession, her everything. All she understands, she does so through the power of math.</p> <p>Roger and Dodger aren’t exactly human, though they don’t realize it. They aren’t exactly gods, either. Not entirely. Not yet.</p> <p>Meet Reed, skilled in the alchemical arts like his progenitor before him. Reed created Dodger and her brother. He’s not their father. Not quite. But he has a plan: To raise the twins to the highest power, to ascend with them and claim their authority as his own.</p> <p>Godhood is attainable. Pray it isn’t attained.</p>";
