The journey will demand the right tools and strategies along with the mindset of money mastery. With decades of collective wisdom and hands-on experience, your guides for this expedition are Peter Mallouk, the only man in history to be ranked the number one financial advisor in the US for three consecutive years by <i>Barron's </i>(2013, 2014, 2015), and Tony Robbins, the world-renowned life and business strategist. Mallouk and Robbins take the seemingly daunting goal of financial freedom and simplify it into a step-by-step process that anyone can achieve.</p> <p>This book is filled with real-life success stories and vital lessons, such as: why the future is better than you think and why there is no greater time in history to be an investor; how to chart your personally tailored course for financial security; how markets behave and how to achieve peace of mind during volatility; what the financial services industry doesn't want you to know; how to select a financial advisor that puts your interests first; how to navigate, select, or reject the many types of investments available; and success without fulfillment is the ultimate failure! Financial freedom is not only about money - it's about feeling deeply fulfilled in your own personal journey.&nbsp;</p>";
