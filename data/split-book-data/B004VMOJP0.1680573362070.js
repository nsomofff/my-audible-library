window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Graham Hancock has spent decades researching and writing some of the most ambitious and successful nonfiction investigations into ancient civilizations and wisdom. <i>Entangled</i> uses all of Hancock's skills and knowledge to propel a fantasy adventure like nothing else preceding it. This is a time-slip novel, alternating between present-day California, Brazil, and prehistoric Spain, with two teenage female protagonists who must come together to avert an incredibly bloodthirsty takeover of the human race. </p> <p>Entangled is the first book in a trilogy relating the story of an unrelentingly evil master magician named Sulpa who is on the loose and determined to destroy humanity. Leoni, a troubled teen from modern-day Los Angeles, and Ria, a young woman who lives in Stone Age Spain, meet in a parallel dimension outside the flow of time to stop Sulpa's spectacular, deadly materialization in the modern world. Riding a growing wave of interest in parallel dimensions and imaginary worlds (<i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i>, and <i>The Golden Compass</i> are recent Hollywood examples), <i>Entangled</i> will have immediate appeal to readers and listeners of Philip Pullman, Stephen King, Neil Gaiman,and Kate Mosse, among others. </p> <p>But <i>Entangled</i> has the added merit of being grounded in solid anthropological and scientific research. Hancock calls on his years of research into cutting-edge issues, including the \"Neanderthal enigma\", the nature of consciousness, the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics, parallel realms, time travel, and near-death and out-of-body experiences.</p>";
