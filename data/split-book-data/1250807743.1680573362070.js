The robot cannot go back until the question of \"what do people need?\" is answered.</p> <p>But the answer to that question depends on who you ask, and how.</p> <p>They're going to need to ask it a <i>lot.</i></p> <p>Becky Chambers' new series asks: In a world where people have what they want, does having more matter?</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Tordotcom </b></p>";
