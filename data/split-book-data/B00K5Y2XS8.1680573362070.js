window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Audie Award Nominee, Classics; Best Male Narrator</b> </p> <p>Widely considered the greatest of Conan Doyleâ€™s Sherlock Holmes stories, <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i> was originally serialized in <i>The Strand Magazine</i> from August 1901 to April 1902. It is the third of only four short novels Doyle wrote about his super sleuth. Set largely on Dartmoor in Devon in England's West Country, it is the gloom-enshrouded story of murder inspired by the family legend of a gigantic, demonic hound of supernatural origin. The book begins with Holmes receiving a visit from a country doctor bearing a strange, ghostly tale concerning a legendary beast that haunts the lonely moors around the Baskerville estate and which appears to be the cause of the death of Sir Charles Baskerville. The legend warns the descendants of the Baskerville family to avoid the moor at certain times, and the newly arrived young heir appears to be in danger. As Holmes swings into action, the ever trusty Watson tags along to witness the thrilling action as it unfolds.</p>";
