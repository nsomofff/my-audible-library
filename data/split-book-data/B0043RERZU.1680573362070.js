window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For the first time in audio, the Cycle of Fire Trilogy, a stout and epic tale mixing sci-fi and fantasy by acclaimed author Janny Wurts. This classic fantasy trilogy follows three young people struggling to free the Stormwarden, the last of the elemental power-wielding Vaere sorcerers, so that he can battle the humanity-threatening demonkind. </p> <p>Far in the future, a human-crewed starship crashes on a distant planet, carrying alien POWs taken to help discover the secrets of a deadly foe, the group mind known as the Gierj. In time, the humans revert to a feudal society, the aliens are seen as \"demons\", and the starship's computer survives as a \"magical\" entity known as the Vaere. </p> <p>In Book 1, <i>Stormwarden</i>, Auskiere, wizard of wind and water, binds the Mharg-demons with the aid of Ivan, master of fire and earth. But at the moment of his greatest peril, Ivan is betrayed and he swears a terrible oath against his betrayer - an oath so powerful that it begins a relentless \"cycle of fire\". </p> <p>Janny Wurts is the author of several fantasy series, including the internationally best-selling Empire trilogy, written in collaboration with Raymond E. Feist. She paints all her own covers, depicting her vision of characters and setting. She is also an expert horsewoman, sailor, musician, and archer.</p>";
