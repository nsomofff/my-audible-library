Dewes' fast-paced sci-fi adventure </b><b><i>The Last Watch</i></b><b>, where a handful of soldiers stand between humanity and annihilation.</b></p> <p>The Divide.</p> <p>It’s the edge of the universe.</p> <p>Now it’s collapsing - and taking everyone and everything with it.</p> <p>The only ones who can stop it are the Sentinels - the recruits, exiles, and court-martialed dregs of the military.</p> <p>At the Divide, Adequin Rake commands the Argus. She has no resources, no comms - nothing, except for the soldiers that no one wanted. Her ace in the hole could be Cavalon Mercer - genius, asshole, and exiled prince who nuked his grandfather's genetic facility for “reasons”.</p> <p>She knows they’re humanity's last chance.</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Tor Books</b></p>";
