But what happened that day on the moors? And where has she been all this time?

His only clue is grainy footage, showing a woman who supposedly died on Bodmin Moor.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dr. Khan's research was theoretical; then she found cracks between our world and parallel Earths. Now these cracks are widening, revealing extraordinary creatures.
