It demands the attention of anyone concerned with our economic future.\" (Lawrence H. Summers, Charles W. Eliot University Professor and President Emeritus at Harvard, former Treasury Secretary)</b></p> <p><b>From Michael J. Casey and Paul Vigna, the authors of </b><b><i>The Age of Cryptocurrency,</i></b><b> comes the definitive audiobook on the Internet’s Next Big Thing: The Blockchain.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Big banks have grown bigger and more entrenched. Privacy exists only until the next hack. Credit card fraud is a fact of life. Many of the “legacy systems” once designed to make our lives easier and our economy more efficient are no longer up to the task. Yet there is a way past all this - a new kind of operating system with the potential to revolutionize vast swaths of our economy: the blockchain.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>The Truth Machine</i>, Michael J. Casey and Paul Vigna demystify the blockchain and explain why it can restore personal control over our data, assets, and identities; grant billions of excluded people access to the global economy; and shift the balance of power to revive society’s faith in itself. They reveal the disruption it promises for industries including finance, tech, legal, and shipping. Casey and Vigna expose the challenge of replacing trusted (and not-so-trusted) institutions on which we’ve relied for centuries with a radical model that bypasses them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Truth Machine</i> reveals the empowerment possible when self-interested middlemen give way to the transparency of the blockchain, while highlighting the job losses, assertion of special interests, and threat to social cohesion that will accompany this shift. With the same balanced perspective they brought to <i>The Age of Cryptocurrency</i>, Casey and Vigna show why listeners must care about the path that blockchain technology takes - moving humanity forward, not backward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
