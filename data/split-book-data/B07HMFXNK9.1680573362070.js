We had assumed they were beaten for good.&nbsp;</p> <p>We were wrong.&nbsp;</p> <p>They’re known as the Host: a cabal of aliens seeking to dominate our sector of space. And they’re back - with help from a powerful new enemy.&nbsp;</p> <p>Against their wrath, we must stand. We’re outnumbered and unprepared. If we lose, we lose everything.&nbsp;</p> <p>But there is hope. An ancient race of long-dead but technologically advanced aliens called the Navigators have a ship called the <i>Blackstar</i> that could potentially turn the tide. That is if I, Kai Locke, a humble ship racer, can find it and learn how to harness its power in time.&nbsp;</p> <p>If I fail, the Coalition will fall, and the Host will consign us to a distant memory. I refuse to let that happen. I will fight to my last breath for the Coalition’s survival.&nbsp;</p> <p>For fans of Star Wars, <i>Firefly</i>, <i>Battlestar</i>, and <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i>.</p>";
