window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Do you ever wonder what is happening inside your brain when you feel anxious, panicked, and worried? In <i>Rewire Your Anxious Brain</i>, psychologist Catherine Pittman and author Elizabeth Karle offer a unique, evidence-based solution to overcoming anxiety, based in cutting-edge neuroscience and research. </p> <p>In this audiobook you will learn how the amygdala and cortex (both important parts of the brain) are essential players in the neuropsychology of anxiety. The amygdala acts as a primal response, and oftentimes, when this part of the brain processes fear, you may not even understand why you are afraid. By comparison the cortex is the center of worry - that is, obsessing, ruminating, and dwelling on things that may or may not happen. </p> <p>Pittman and Karle offer simple, specific examples of how to manage fear by tapping in to both of these pathways in the brain. As you listen, you'll gain a greater understanding of how anxiety is created in the brain, and as a result you will feel empowered and motivated to overcome it. </p> <p>The brain is a powerful tool, and the more you work to change the way you respond to fear, the more resilient you will become. Using the practical self-assessments and proven-effective techniques in this book, you will learn to literally \"rewire\" the brain processes that lie at the root of your fears. </p>";
